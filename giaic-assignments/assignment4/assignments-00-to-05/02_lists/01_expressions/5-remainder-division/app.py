# Problem Statement
# Ask the user for two numbers, one at a time, and then print the result of dividing the first number by the second and also the remainder of the division.
    
#     solution

def main():
    dividend: int = int(input("Please enter an integer to be divided:"))
    divisor: int = int(input("Please enter an integer to divide by: "))

    quotient: int = dividend // divisor
    remainder: int = dividend % divisor

    print(f"The result of division is {quotient} with a reaminder of {remainder}.")

main()
