# Problem Statement
# Fill out the double(num) function to return the result of multiplying num by 2. We've written a main() function 
# for you which asks the user for a number, calls your code for double(num) , and prints the result.

# Solution
def main():
    while True:
        user_num = int(input("Enter a number or press enter to Exit"))
        user_num = 2* user_num
        print(user_num) 

main()
