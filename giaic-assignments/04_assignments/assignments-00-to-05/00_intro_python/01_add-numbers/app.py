# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program 
# should perform the following tasks:

# Prompt the user to enter the first number.
# Read the input and convert it to an integer.
# Prompt the user to enter the second number.
# Read the input and convert it to an integer.
# Calculate the sum of the two numbers.
# Print the total sum with an appropriate message.

#  âœ…solution

def main():
     print("ðŸ“ŒYou can add two numbers here")
     num1: str = input("Enter the first number: ")
     num1 = int(num1)
     num2: str = input("Enter the second number: ") 
     num2 = int(num2)
     total: int = num1 + num2
     print(f"â­•The sum of given numbers is: {total}")
